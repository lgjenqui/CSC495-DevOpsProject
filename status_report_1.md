**Accomplishments:**\
Sam:
- Set up GitHub Actions runner on DigitalOcean server
- Created an EsLint Linter for the Coffee Project's Javascript files
- Created a GitHub actions pipeline that runs the linter
- Fixed the current Coffee Project so it passes the linter rules
- GitHub Commit: (https://github.ncsu.edu/CSC519-lgjenqui-jjohn6-sjstone3/CSC519-Project/commit/73adcf93203f41448d39580086cb9375575700)


Luke:

Jubitta:
- Created a Github action for running Chai unit test.
- Created a job in the Github action to generate the code coverage for statements, branches, functions and lines. The threshold coverage set is to 75.
- Modified the current Coffee Project so that the server is started only when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module for unit testing.

**Next Steps:**
- Create steps in pipeline to trigger npm audit after opening a PR to release
- Create steps in pipeline to trigger canary deployment after release engineer approves PR into release
- Create Dockerfile to run Ansible
- Create Ansible playbook that configures Kubernetes
- Create Ansible playbook for Canary Deployment
- Create steps in pipeline to trigger final deployment after release engineer approves PR into main
- Create Ansible playbook for final deployment


**Retrospectives:**
- What worked:

- What didn't work:

    Codecov is used to generate the coverage report. The Codecov generates the coverage report and checks the thresold coverage as 75%, which can be seen   in the Actions tab under the GitHub actions job result. However, there is trouble in uploading the coverage to Codecov. Â Only if the report is uploaded, the coverage report can be seen on the PR. The Codecov is getting connected to the personal GitHub but unable to find a way to link the Codecov to Ncsu GitHub(Github enterprise).
 
- What to do differently:

  To solve the issue with Codecov report not being uploaded, planning to use a different tool to generate coverage report like JSCover or need to figure out a better work around to address the issue.
