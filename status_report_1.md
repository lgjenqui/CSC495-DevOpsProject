**Accomplishments:**\
Sam:
- Set up GitHub Actions runner on DigitalOcean server
- Created an EsLint Linter for the Coffee Project's Javascript files
- Created a GitHub actions pipeline that runs the linter
- Fixed the current Coffee Project so it passes the linter rules
- GitHub Commit: (https://github.ncsu.edu/CSC519-lgjenqui-jjohn6-sjstone3/CSC519-Project/commit/af72697224bb4782fcd0ddddc1f876124afb33eb)
- GitHub PR: (https://github.ncsu.edu/CSC519-lgjenqui-jjohn6-sjstone3/CSC519-Project/pull/24/files)

Luke:
- Set up overarching pipeline structure, ensuring that they run at the proper times, including 
    1. The feature to development pipeline when a PR is opened,
    2. The common vulnerability job when a feature to development or development to release PR is opened,
    3. The build and canary release workflow when a release PR is merged, and 
    4. the final deploy workflow to complete the deployment after a PR is merged into main.
- Created the Dockerfile to build the image for our release strategies. 
- Created and tested the branch protection rules to prevent pushing or merging incorrectly without sufficient permissions or approval.

- GitHub PR: (https://github.ncsu.edu/CSC519-lgjenqui-jjohn6-sjstone3/CSC519-Project/pull/22)



Jubitta:
- Created a Github action for running Chai unit test.
- Created a job in the Github action to generate the code coverage for statements, branches, functions and lines. The threshold coverage set is to 75.
- Modified the current Coffee Project so that the server is started only when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module for unit testing.

**Next Steps:**
- Create steps in pipeline to trigger npm audit after opening a PR to release - Luke
- Create steps in pipeline to trigger canary deployment after release engineer approves PR into release - Sam
- Create Dockerfile to run Ansible - Sam
- Create Ansible playbook that configures Kubernetes - Sam
- Create Ansible playbook for Canary Deployment - Luke
- Create steps in pipeline to trigger final deployment after release engineer approves PR into main - Jubitta
- Create Ansible playbook for final deployment - Jubitta


**Retrospectives:**
- What worked:
    - The team was able to get most of the tasks done and they were divided relatively evenly
    - The beginning parts of the pipeline are set up and just need to be combined together

- What didn't work:
    - We weren't able to combine all of our work together by the end of the sprint.
    - Codecov is used to generate the coverage report. The Codecov generates the coverage report and checks the thresold coverage as 75%, which can be seen   in the Actions tab under the GitHub actions job result. However, there is trouble in uploading the coverage to Codecov. Â Only if the report is uploaded, the coverage report can be seen on the PR. The Codecov is getting connected to the personal GitHub but unable to find a way to link the Codecov to Ncsu GitHub(Github enterprise).
 
- What to do differently:
    - We should allocate more time to integrate all of our work together.
    - To solve the issue with Codecov report not being uploaded, planning to use a different tool to generate coverage report like JSCover or need to figure out a better work around to address the issue.
